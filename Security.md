# Security Policy

## Our Commitment
Project Buni is committed to building secure, decentralized tools. Since we are working with Bitcoin-native protocols like Lightning and Cashu, we prioritize the safety of our users and their data.

## Supported Versions
During our 2026 development phase, only the latest version of our codebase is supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We strongly believe in "Responsible Disclosure." If you find a security vulnerability, please do not report it via a public GitHub Issue. Instead, please follow this process:

1. **Private Report:** Send a detailed email to **[sammymuchai44@gmil.com]** or reach out privately to **Sam Macharia** or the Technical Leads (Martin/Yankho) via our official communication channels.
2. **Details to Include:**
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact.
3. **Response Time:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

## Security Best Practices for Our Developers
As part of the Project Buni cohort, all builders are expected to:
- Never commit private keys, seeds, or sensitive environment variables to the repo.
- Use `.env` files for local development and ensure they are listed in `.gitignore`.
- Sanitize all inputs to prevent common attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
