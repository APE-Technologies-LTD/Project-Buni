# Project Buni ⚡🏗️

Project Buni is a 2026 builder initiative based in Kenya, focused on developing open-source, decentralized tools for the local Bitcoin ecosystem.

## 🌟 Our Mission
To move from users to architects. We are a cohort of 21 developers and specialists learning-by-building. Our goal is to create high-utility tools that leverage Bitcoin-native protocols to solve local challenges.

## 🛠️ Technical Pillars
* **Lightning Network:** Enabling instant, low-cost payments.
* **Nostr:** Utilizing decentralized, censorship-resistant communication layers.
* **Cashu:** Integrating privacy-preserving Ecash (Chaumian Mints).

## 📅 2026 Roadmap
* **Phase 1: Foundations (Current):** 3-week intensive intro to Bitcoin protocols led by Martin Mutonga & Yankho.
* **Phase 2: Ideation & Architecture:** Defining the specific tool we will launch for the Kenyan community.
* **Phase 3: The Build:** Open-source collaboration and development.

## 🤝 Contributing
Participation is currently focused on our 2026 cohort. However, as an open-source project, we welcome audits, feedback, and pull requests from the wider Bitcoin community.
